# Dhow

> **Ship to your own servers — safely.**
> A secure, self-hosted continuous deployment platform. Arabic-first.

**Status:** 🚧 Under construction, not ready for production yet. Foundations (M1), identity and organizations (M2) and most
of runners and isolation (M3) are done: password, TOTP, passkey and OIDC sign-in, organizations, teams and roles, the audit
log, and runners that run every job in a throwaway rootless container with the network closed except to allowed hosts,
live logs, and `dhow-runner install`. Pipelines, secrets, approvals and deploy targets come in M4 to M6
([roadmap](docs/en/roadmap.md)). Feedback is welcome through issues and discussions.

## What Dhow is

Dhow is a **self-hosted Continuous Deployment control plane**. It takes your code or a built artifact and
delivers it to infrastructure you own (VPS, on-prem servers, Docker hosts, Kubernetes, static/CDN), with:

- **Isolated runners.** Every job runs in an ephemeral, sandboxed container (microVM optional). Nothing runs on the control plane host.
- **Pipeline-as-code.** A `.dhow.yml` file in your repo, plus a visual editor that writes the YAML and opens a PR.
- **Environments and approvals.** Protection rules, required reviewers and deployment windows.
- **Instant rollback.** Atomic releases with health checks and automatic rollback.
- **Scoped, encrypted secrets.** Secrets are injected only at runtime. Workload OIDC removes the need for long-lived cloud keys.
- **Audit by default.** An append-only, tamper-evident log of who deployed what, where, and when.

Dhow **integrates with** your CI. It does not try to replace it. Build inside Dhow, or let GitHub Actions /
GitLab CI build and hand Dhow the artifact through an official action.

## Who it is for

- Developers worldwide who want a secure, open-source way to deploy to their own infrastructure.
- Small and mid-size companies and agencies running VPS fleets or on-prem servers.
- The Arabic-speaking market. The UI is designed **Arabic-first** (RTL first, LTR second), not as a mirrored English UI.

See [docs/editions-and-licensing.md](docs/en/editions-and-licensing.md).

## Install

Dhow installs with one Docker Compose file: `./init.sh` generates strong secrets, then `docker compose up -d` starts an empty, hardened instance with its own PostgreSQL. Images are signed with cosign and ship with an SBOM.
See [docs/install/](docs/en/install/README.md) to choose a method, then the [Compose guide](docs/en/install/compose.md) for the quick start, upgrades, backups and signature verification.
A host needs at least 1 CPU core, 2 GiB of memory and 5 GiB of free disk (2 cores, 4 GiB and 20 GiB recommended): see [Hardware requirements](docs/en/requirements.md).

## Relationship to Deploy Center

Dhow is the from-scratch successor to **Deploy Center v3**. We built Deploy Center after an attack on our servers, to
deploy without SSH keys spread everywhere. A later review found problems in its foundations that patching cannot fix:
pipelines run on the control plane host with its privileges, commands are built as shell strings, and sessions cannot be
revoked. So Deploy Center receives security fixes only, and a migration tool will import its projects into Dhow. See
[ADR-0002](Plan/ADR/0002-rewrite-with-v3-hotfix.md).
