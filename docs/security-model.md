# Security model

Status: **Draft v0.2**. Security is the product: every design choice below is a default, not an option.

## 1. Assets

The assets to protect are:
- Deployment targets: production servers and clusters.
- Secrets: environment secrets, target credentials and the KEK.
- Source code and artifacts.
- The audit trail.
- User accounts and sessions.

## 2. Threat model

| Actor | Capability | Primary controls |
|---|---|---|
| **Malicious or compromised developer** | Can push code and edit `.dhow.yml` in repos they can write to | Sandboxed runners (no host access); environment protection rules and approvals; secrets scoped per environment; branch restrictions per environment; audit |
| **External contributor (PR from a fork)** | Can open PRs, so attacker-controlled code reaches CI | Fork PR jobs run with **no secrets** and are restricted to non-deploy environments. Running them needs maintainer approval, and the pipeline definition always comes from the base branch for privileged events |
| **Compromised runner host** | Full control of one runner | A runner only receives secrets for jobs leased to it. A runner identity can be revoked instantly. Runners can be pinned to environments through labels and pools. Runners never get control-plane credentials or database access |
| **Network attacker** | MITM between components or against targets | TLS everywhere. Runner identity keys are pinned, and the control plane signs every lease grant with a key the runner pinned at registration, so a compromised proxy cannot inject jobs. Secrets are sealed end to end to the runner's key (HPKE). SSH host keys and TLS fingerprints are pinned per target. Webhooks are verified with HMAC and replay protection |
| **Stolen session or token** | Holds a user's cookie or API token | Server-side sessions with an idle and an absolute timeout. A session is revoked at once by sign-out, password change, MFA change, role change or an admin action. Cookies are `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and `SameSite=Strict`, and every state-changing request needs a CSRF token. High-risk actions require re-authentication. API tokens are scoped and expire |
| **Unauthenticated internet attacker** | Can reach the public endpoints | Registration is closed. Every route requires authentication by default. Rate limits apply per IP *and* per account. There is no unauthenticated realtime channel |
| **Malicious plugin author** | Publishes a step image | Plugins run inside the job sandbox with the job's privileges only. Plugins are referenced by digest. The registry marks verified publishers and requires signatures (cosign) |

## 3. Secure defaults

- **Registration.** Public registration is **closed**. The first owner account is created through a one-time setup URL. After that, users join by invitation. An external identity provider (OIDC or GitHub) only signs in an account that already exists and has linked that identity; it never creates an account (ADR-0039).
- **Fail closed on weak configuration.** The server **refuses to boot** with missing, placeholder, short or reused secrets. Real environment variables take precedence over config files.
- **TLS** is required outside localhost. HSTS is on. Cookies are `Secure`, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict`.
- **Strict CSP:** `default-src 'self'`, no inline script, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, Trusted Types.
- **No secret values in any API response, log line, error message or notification.**

## 4. Authentication (ADR-0013)

| Method | Edition |
|---|---|
| Password with Argon2id, breached-password check (k-anonymity, optional offline list) and max length | Community |
| TOTP. Enrolling or changing it requires the current factor. Replay protection stores the last accepted step | Community |
| **Passkeys (WebAuthn)**, the phishing-resistant method and the recommended default | Community |
| OIDC login (Google, Keycloak, any OIDC IdP) and GitHub (OAuth 2.0), linked per account | Community |
| SAML 2.0, SCIM provisioning, group→team sync | Business+ |

**Login flow.** The password step only yields a short-lived, single-use `mfa_pending` challenge that is bound to the user and the device. The second factor must present that challenge. A user id taken from the client is never trusted.

- **The challenge.** A correct password for an account with TOTP or a passkey answers `202` and sets `__Host-dhow_mfa` (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/`, 5 minutes). It holds 32 random bytes, and the server stores only their SHA-256. It is bound to the user and to a hash of the User-Agent, not to the IP address, because the address of a real user can change within the same minute (IPv4/IPv6 switching, mobile handover, CGNAT). Only `POST /api/v1/sessions/mfa` turns it into a session, and it works once. Five wrong codes burn it.
- **Throttling.** Second-step attempts are counted per user and per client address before they are checked, like passwords ([section 5](#5-sessions-and-tokens-adr-0033)). The per-user counter is separate from the password counter, so passing the password again never buys more guesses.
- **TOTP.** The secret (160 bits) is generated on the server and stored sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from `DHOW_SECRET_KEY` (HKDF-SHA256, one label per purpose) with a random nonce per record and the user id as associated data. One step of clock skew is accepted on each side, and the last accepted step is stored, so a code never works twice. The QR code is drawn in the browser.
- **Recovery codes.** Ten codes of 80 random bits each, shown once and stored as HMAC-SHA256 under a derived key. Each works once, and each use is audited.
- **Passkeys.** The RP ID and the only accepted origin come from `DHOW_PUBLIC_URL`. Challenges are stored on the server, live 5 minutes and work once. Passwordless sign-in requires user verification. A sign-count that goes backwards is refused and audited.
- **Changing a factor.** Turning TOTP on, off or replacing it, making new recovery codes, and adding or removing a passkey need a current factor in the same request: the password while the account has no second factor, and a TOTP code, recovery code or passkey afterwards. Every such change revokes the user's other sessions and is audited.

**External identity providers (ADR-0039).** Providers are configured only through the environment (`DHOW_OIDC_PROVIDERS`, see [Sign in with OIDC](guides/oidc.md)), and any invalid provider stops the server. Two providers cannot share an issuer. Discovery happens on first use, so an unreachable provider disables only that provider (`503 OIDC_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`); one discovery runs at a time and no caller waits past its own deadline. The authorization, token and JWKS endpoints the provider announces must be `https` (plain `http` only with `DHOW_DEV=true`), otherwise the provider counts as unavailable. Flow rows are deleted a day after they expire (see [Retention of temporary rows](#retention-of-temporary-rows)).

- **The flow.** `POST /api/v1/oidc/authorize` sets `__Host-dhow_oidc` (32 random bytes, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`, 10 minutes) and returns the provider URL with a random `state`, a PKCE `S256` challenge and, for OIDC, a `nonce`. The PKCE verifier and the nonce are not stored: they are HMACs of the cookie under a key derived from `DHOW_SECRET_KEY`. The server stores only SHA-256 hashes of the cookie, the state and the User-Agent, so a database copy cannot finish a flow.
- **The callback.** The provider returns to the web page `<DHOW_PUBLIC_URL>/oidc/callback/<id>` (one URL per provider, against mix-up attacks), which strips `code` and `state` from the address and posts them once to `POST /api/v1/oidc/callback`. The flow row is consumed before the code is exchanged; a missing or forged cookie, a wrong state, another browser, another provider, or a used or expired flow burns it without contacting the provider and answers `400 OIDC_FLOW_INVALID`.
- **The ID token** is verified with `go-oidc`: signature against the provider's JWKS, issuer, audience, expiry, `azp` when present or when there are several audiences, and the nonce in constant time. Provider responses are capped at 1 MB, redirects are refused, and calls time out after 10 seconds. GitHub has no ID token: the subject is the numeric account `id` from `GET /user`, never the login, which can be renamed and reused.
- **Linking.** An identity is matched only by `(issuer, subject)`, under a unique index. The email from the provider is shown but never used to find an account, so an identity whose email equals an existing account's email cannot sign in to it (`401 OIDC_NOT_LINKED`). Linking and unlinking happen from the account page, need the current factor and a browser session, revoke the user's other sessions and are audited. The last sign-in method (password, passkey or linked identity) can never be unlinked (`409 LAST_SIGN_IN_METHOD`), checked under a row lock on the user.
- **Allowed domains.** `DHOW_OIDC_<ID>_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` accepts an identity only if it has a verified email whose domain is exactly one of the list; otherwise `403 OIDC_DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED`, both at sign-in and when linking.
- **Second step and session.** An account with TOTP or a passkey gets the same `mfa_pending` challenge as after a password; the provider's own MFA does not replace Dhow's. The challenge keeps the first step, so the `auth.login` event records both: `Method` is the second step and `FirstMethod` is `oidc:<id>` or `password`. A successful sign-in rotates the session exactly like a password sign-in. A Dhow session is independent of the provider session: signing out of the provider does not sign out of Dhow.

**Lockout.** Lockout counters are per account and per IP, with exponential backoff (details in [section 5](#5-sessions-and-tokens-adr-0033)). Error messages are generic and responses take constant time.

## 5. Sessions and tokens (ADR-0033)

The web UI and the API are served from the same origin, so browsers use **server-side sessions** with a cookie. There is no JWT for browsers: a JWT would still need a server-side lookup on every request to be revocable, and it would live in JavaScript.

- **Cookie.** `__Host-dhow_session` with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` and `Path=/`, and no `Domain`. The `__Host-` prefix makes browsers refuse a cookie set by a sub-domain or over plain HTTP. `Secure` is always set, because the public URL is HTTPS by design.
- **Session id.** 32 random bytes. Only its SHA-256 hash is stored in `"Sessions"`, so a database leak does not yield usable cookies.
- **Lifetime.** A session ends after **12 hours without activity** (idle timeout) or **14 days** after sign-in (absolute timeout), whichever comes first. `LastSeenAt` is written at most once a minute, so reads do not turn into writes.
- **Rotation.** Signing in always issues a new session id and revokes the session the request carried. When a member's effective role in any organization changes (a direct role change, a team binding, joining or leaving a team, removal), every session of that member is revoked, so the next request needs a fresh sign-in and a new id. The person making the change keeps only the session they are using. Accepting an invitation while signed in keeps the current session: session ids are only ever minted at sign-in, so there is nothing to fixate (ADR-0038).
- **Revocation is immediate.** Every request checks the session row, with no cache. Sign-out, password change, MFA change, role change, an admin "sign out everywhere" and "sign out of every other device" all revoke sessions server-side. A disabled or deleted user loses every session at once.
- **CSRF.**
  - Every request that is not `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` needs an `X-CSRF-Token` header and an `Origin` header equal to `DHOW_PUBLIC_URL`. Otherwise the answer is `403 CSRF_FAILED`.
  - The token is an HMAC of the session id under a key derived from `DHOW_SECRET_KEY`. It is bound to one session, `GET /api/v1/me` returns it, and the server stores only its hash.
  - Sign-in and setup have no session yet, so they skip the token but still check `Origin`.
  - Responses of the API are never cacheable (`Cache-Control: no-store`).
- **Passwords.** Argon2id (m=19 MiB, t=2, p=1, 16-byte salt, 32-byte key), stored as a PHC string and compared in constant time. A hash made with older parameters is replaced after the next successful sign-in. The length is 12 to 128 characters.
  - **Breached passwords.** When a password is set or changed, the server asks the Have I Been Pwned range API. Only the first 5 hex characters of the password's SHA-1 leave the server (k-anonymity), padding is requested, and the call times out after 3 seconds. If the service cannot be reached, the change goes through and a warning is logged. `DHOW_BREACHED_PASSWORD_CHECK=false` turns the check off for isolated networks.
- **Sign-in throttling.** Failures are counted per account and per client address. After 5 failures for an account, or 20 for an address, the key is locked for 30 seconds, and every further failure doubles the lock up to 15 minutes. A key forgets its failures after an hour without one, and a successful sign-in resets the account. Attempts are counted before the password is checked, in one transaction that locks both counters, so a burst of parallel guesses gets no more attempts than a slow one. Attempts made during a lock are refused without being counted, so nobody can extend a lock. A locked key answers with the same generic `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` error plus `Retry-After`. Unknown accounts are throttled exactly like real ones, and the unknown-account path still runs a full Argon2id verification, so neither the answer nor its timing shows whether an account exists.
- **CLI, CI and integrations** use **personal API tokens**, never a session (ADR-0039).
  - **Format and storage.** `dhow_pat_` followed by 32 random bytes in base64url, so secret scanners can detect them. Only an HMAC-SHA256 under a key derived from `DHOW_SECRET_KEY` is stored, and the value is shown once, in the creation response.
  - **Scope.** A token belongs to one organization and to the creator's membership row, and carries explicit scopes that are policy actions (`org.read`, `org.update`, `member.read`, `member.manage`, `audit.read`, `runner.read`, `runner.manage`, `job.read`, `job.cancel`). `job.create` is not a scope: a job runs any image on any runner of the organization, so creating jobs needs a browser session. Every scope must be allowed by the creator's role at creation (`403 SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED`). Expiry is mandatory, 1 to 366 days, and a user can hold at most 50 active tokens.
  - **Never above the creator.** On every request a token is allowed an action only if the action is in its scopes **and** the creator's current effective role allows it. A demotion narrows the token at once, a promotion never widens it, and leaving or being removed from the organization, a disabled account or a deleted organization stops it for good.
  - **Creating** a token needs a browser session and the current factor. The owner lists and revokes their tokens from `/api/v1/me/api-tokens`; Owners and Admins (`token.manage`) can list and revoke every token of the organization. Revoking needs no factor.
  - **Which routes.** Only `Authorization: Bearer dhow_pat_…` counts as a token; other schemes are ignored. A route accepts tokens only if its policy row says so explicitly (`AllowTokens`), and `openapi.yaml` declares the `ApiToken` scheme on exactly those routes, which a test enforces. A token on any other route, public or not, answers `403 SESSION_REQUIRED`: password, MFA, passkeys, linked identities, preferences, sessions, token management, leaving an organization (including removing your own membership), transferring ownership and creating jobs are browser-only. A token can never confirm a current factor.
  - **No mixing.** A Bearer token together with a Dhow cookie answers `401`. Bearer requests skip the `Origin` and CSRF checks, because browsers never attach an `Authorization` header on their own and the server sends no CORS headers. Runner tokens (`dhow_rat_`) are refused on the REST API, and personal tokens are refused on `/runner-api/`.
  - `LastUsedAt` and `LastUsedIp` are written at most once a minute.
  - **Credential events.** An admin's MFA reset revokes every token of the member together with their sessions, because it is the path for recovering a compromised account whose owner may not hold it. Changing the password or a factor and "sign out of every other device" do not revoke tokens: a token is a separate credential for automation, bound to the membership and role and limited by its scopes and expiry, and revoking it on a routine password change would silently stop CI. Someone who suspects a compromise revokes their tokens from the account page, and disabling the account stops all of them.

### Retention of temporary rows

Rows that only exist to run a sign-in, a throttle or a rate limit are deleted for real once they can no longer matter, so the tables do not grow with every attempt (ADR-0040). Every 10 minutes one instance, chosen by a PostgreSQL advisory lock, deletes them in batches of 1000 with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so a row a request is using is never touched and no table stays locked for long:

| Table | Deleted |
|---|---|
| `LoginThrottles`, `RunnerThrottles` | a day after the last failure, once no lock is active |
| `AuthChallenges`, `OidcFlows`, `SetupTokens` | a day after they expire |
| `Invitations` | 30 days after they expire or are revoked; accepted invitations stay |
| `RateLimits` | an hour after their window ends |

These are the only deletes in the code base, all in one query file that a project hook checks: every other table, including the audit log, memberships, sessions and tokens, is only ever marked deleted.

## 6. Authorization (ADR-0015)

- A **single policy function**, `can(subject, action, resource)`, is the only path to authorization.
  - Handlers declare the action and resource, and middleware enforces them.
  - Resource loaders are tenant-scoped, so a missing check results in "not found", not a data leak.
- **Fixed roles** apply per scope (Organization → Project → Environment):

| Role | Summary |
|---|---|
| Owner | Billing/license, org deletion, everything |
| Admin | Manage org, members, runners, all projects |
| Maintainer | Manage project settings, environments, protection rules, secrets |
| Developer | Trigger deployments to environments their rules allow; read logs |
| Viewer | Read-only on assigned projects |

- **Teams** group users, and roles can be granted to teams through role bindings. A binding has a scope (organization, project or environment); M2.3 implements the organization scope. A member's **effective role** is the highest of their direct role and the roles of every team they belong to, and it is computed in one place (`Core/Policy`). A binding can never grant Owner.
- **Granting rules.** Nobody can grant a role above their own, members with a higher role can only be changed by someone at least as high, and only an Owner can make or unmake an Owner. Granting or removing Owner, transferring ownership and resetting another member's MFA all need the actor's current factor (password, TOTP or passkey). Nobody changes their own role; they leave or transfer instead. The last Owner of an organization can never be removed, demoted or leave, and membership changes take a row lock on the organization so two parallel requests cannot both pass that check. Disabled or deleted accounts do not count as owners, so ownership never rests on them alone. Team writes and invitation acceptance re-check the actor's or inviter's role under the same lock, so a demotion that commits meanwhile is seen.
- **Invitations.** An invitation names an email and a role no higher than the inviter's, and never Owner. The token is 32 random bytes, only its SHA-256 hash is stored, it works once and expires after 7 days, and a resend replaces it. The link carries the token in the URL fragment (`/invite#…`), which browsers never send to the server, and the page removes it from the address at once; the API takes it only in a request body. Accepting checks again that the inviter is still an active member with a role that may grant it; a resend makes its actor the inviter. A used, revoked, expired or unknown token answers with the same `410 INVITATION_INVALID`. A signed-in account joins only when its email matches the invitation, and nobody joins without a token. Email is optional (`DHOW_SMTP_*`): when sending fails, the invitation still exists, shows that the email failed, and the inviter can copy the link.
- **Organizations.** By default only the instance owner (the account created at setup) can create more organizations; `DHOW_ORG_CREATION=any-user` opens it to every signed-in user. A request about an organization the caller is not a member of answers `404`.
- **Admin MFA reset.** An Owner or Admin can reset another member's two-step sign-in after confirming their own current factor, only if their role is strictly higher than the member's effective role in every organization the member belongs to: an Owner resets an Admin and below, an Admin resets a Maintainer and below, and nobody resets someone of the same rank. The instance owner counts as an Owner everywhere. The member is signed out everywhere and asked to enroll again, and the audit event is marked high severity.
- **Custom roles and OPA policies** come from `ee/`.
- **Testing:** a test walks the **entire route table** for every role and scope and asserts the expected allow or deny result. A route without a declared policy fails the build.

## 7. Execution safety

- **Isolation (ADR-0007, ADR-0043).** Jobs only run inside a rootless container or microVM, with limits, a read-only root filesystem, network egress denied by default, and no host mounts. The control plane never executes user code.
  - The default sandbox is rootless Podman with all capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, a seccomp profile that also blocks nested user namespaces, `io_uring`, `bpf`, `ptrace` and `mount`, and a separate user-namespace range per job.
  - A runner refuses to start if cgroup v2 delegation for CPU, memory and PIDs is missing, and it fails the job if the created container does not match the policy.
  - An escape test suite (host files, runner credentials, other jobs, metadata endpoints, container sockets, privilege escalation, network) is a required CI check.
- **Network egress (ADR-0044).** A sandbox has no network interface besides loopback. Allowed hosts are reached only through a per-job proxy in the runner. The proxy resolves names itself, connects to the address it resolved, and always denies private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT and cloud metadata ranges. Only the runner operator can open a private range.
- **Runner plane (ADR-0041, ADR-0042).**
  - Runners authenticate with pinned Ed25519 keys and 15-minute access tokens.
  - Starting a job needs a fresh signature.
  - Every mutating call carries the attempt's fencing token.
  - Session cookies are rejected on the runner plane, and runner tokens are rejected on the public API.
- **No shell strings in platform code.**
  - Every process the platform starts (git, ssh, rsync, docker, kubectl) uses argv arrays.
  - User-controlled values are validated against strict grammars: refs go through `git check-ref-format`, SHAs must match `^[0-9a-f]{40}$`, and URLs go through a parser with a scheme allowlist.
  - Those values are passed after `--`.
- **Expressions use CEL.** CEL is non-Turing-complete, evaluates against typed variables, has cost limits, and never performs string-concatenation evaluation.
- **No regex "WAF" as a security control.** Correctness comes from parameterized queries, typed validation and output encoding.

## 8. Data protection

- Secrets use envelope encryption (see [architecture §6](architecture.md#6-secrets)): AES-256-GCM with a random 12-byte nonce, AAD bound to the record, and versioned keys with rotation.
- Webhook secrets, target credentials and API-token peppers are all treated as secrets.
- Masking happens in the runner, on the stream, before any output leaves the host.
- Retention policies apply to logs, artifacts and audit events. Export and deletion tooling supports GDPR-style requests.

## 9. Audit

- The audit log is append-only, and each event includes `PrevHash`, which makes the log **tamper-evident**.
  - Every event stores `Hash = SHA-256(PrevHash ‖ canonical JSON of the event)`, and events form one chain per organization (plus one for instance-level events). Writers take a per-chain advisory lock, so the chain never forks.
  - A database trigger rejects `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` on the table. `GET /api/v1/organizations/{id}/audit-events/verify` walks a chain and reports the first event whose hash or link is wrong.
  - Event data never carries a secret: passwords, tokens and cookies are not recorded. Only fields on an explicit allowlist are written, and anything else is dropped with a warning; a value that contains a Dhow credential prefix (`dhow_pat_`, `dhow_rat_`, `dhow_rrt_`) is dropped too. A test scans the modules for every field they write and fails if one is missing from the allowlist, and every end-to-end test fails if a real event loses a field.
  - An action made with an API token records `Via=api_token` and `ViaId` (the token id) next to the actor. Creating and revoking a token, linking and unlinking an identity, and failed provider sign-ins after a valid flow (with the reason and a digest of the issuer and subject) are audited.
- Every security-relevant action is recorded, including auth events, role changes, secret writes, approvals, deployments and runner registration.
- **Retention:** Community keeps 90 days. Business and Enterprise get longer retention, export, and SIEM streaming.

## 10. Supply chain

- Releases are reproducible builds, **signed with cosign** (keyless), and published with an **SBOM** (SPDX) and SLSA provenance.
- Container images are distroless and non-root, and are referenced by digest in the Helm and Compose manifests.
- **CI:**
  - It is **required** for merge: tests, lint with zero warnings allowed, type checks, `govulncheck`/`npm audit` blocking on high and critical, CodeQL, secret scanning and license checks.
  - Dependabot updates are merged only on green CI.
- An external penetration test is required before GA, and again yearly.
- The disclosure policy is in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## 11. Lessons from the Deploy Center v3 audit

Each class of vulnerability found in Deploy Center v3, and the design rule in Dhow that removes it:

| v3 issue class | Dhow design rule |
|---|---|
| Public registration accepted a client-supplied role (anyone could become admin) | Registration is closed by default. Request bodies are decoded into typed DTOs with **no role field**. Roles change only through an authorized, audited endpoint |
| The realtime socket had no authentication and broadcast full records containing secrets | Realtime runs over **SSE behind the same session auth**. Every stream is authorized per resource. Payloads are explicit DTOs and never ORM objects. There are no global broadcasts |
| The 2FA step trusted a client-supplied user id, so the password step could be skipped | Server-held `mfa_pending` challenge, bound to the password step; lockout per account |
| Pipelines executed directly on the server host | The control plane never executes user code. Jobs run only in sandboxed runners |
| Commands were built by string interpolation and run through a shell | argv-only process execution, with strict validation of refs, SHAs, URLs and options |
| Conditions were evaluated with dynamic code construction | CEL, with typed inputs and cost limits |
| The API returned webhook secrets and credentials in plaintext | Secrets are write-only. Response DTOs contain no secret fields. Everything is encrypted at rest |
| Routes lacked object-level checks (IDOR) | A central `can()` policy, tenant-scoped loaders, non-enumerable UUIDv7 ids, and route-table authorization tests |
| Hardcoded fallback secrets were accepted in production | Boot fails on missing or placeholder secrets. The installer generates strong ones |
| Stateless long-lived JWTs could not be revoked | Server-side sessions stored as hashes, checked on every request, revoked at once, with idle and absolute timeouts and CSRF tokens |
| In-place `rsync --delete` deploys with fragile backups | Atomic releases (symlink switch), health checks, automatic rollback to the previous release |
| Queue retries re-ran whole, non-idempotent deployments | No automatic retry after the first mutating step. Leases and reconciliation handle crashed jobs, and an environment lock prevents concurrent deployments |
| Notification URLs allowed SSRF and blocked the single worker | A separate notification queue with timeouts, plus an SSRF guard that checks the resolved IP |
| An idempotency cache was not bound to the user and replayed cookies | Idempotency keys are scoped to the authenticated principal. Auth endpoints and `Set-Cookie` are never cached |
| Coverage gates excluded files that were never loaded, and integration tests bypassed the real middleware stack | Coverage is measured over all packages. E2E tests run against the real server binary, and CI fails if a required service is missing |
